# Ring of the Grammarian
A rare ring that allows the wearer to alter one letter of a spell's title to alter the spell for a different affect. It can be used once per day. The effect of the altered spell is determined by the DM, taking the caster's intentions into account.\
This python script allows a wearer to enter the name of a spell. All possible spell title alterations (changing only one letter) will be listed. Alterated words are looked up in an English word dictionary containing 479k words from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.\
Use ``ctrl+c`` to exit the script.
